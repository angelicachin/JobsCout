            <p class="description">PT Bank Mandiri Tbk is Indonesia's second-largest financial institution by assets. Bank Mandiri offers businesses and individuals throughout Indonesia a 
                full set of banking and non-banking products and services. The company also serves international clients with subsidiaries, branches and representative offices in London, 
                Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaysia, Timor Leste, Shanghai, and the Cayman Islands. Bank Mandiri was established as a consequence of the Asian Financial Crisis. When the 
                Indonesian financial sector had collapsed in the late 1990s, four state-owned banks (Bank Exim, Bank Bumi Daya, Bank Dagang Negara and Bapindo) were merged into Bank Mandiri 
                as part of the government's bank restructuring program. <br> <br>
                After going through a thorough consolidation and integration process in all fields, Bank Mandiri succeeded in building a solid bank organization and implementing a new, 
                integrated core banking system replacing the separate core banking systems of the four previous legacy banks. Since its founding, Bank Mandiri's performance has continuously 
                improved as seen from profits which continued to increase from IDR 1.18 trillion in 2000 to IDR 5.3 trillion in 2004. Bank Mandiri conducted an initial share offering on July 
                14 2003 amounting to 20% or the equivalent of 4 billion shares.
