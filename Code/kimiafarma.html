            <p class="description">Kimia Farma was the first pharmaceutical industry company in Indonesia established by the Dutch Indies Government in 1817. 
                The name of this company was originally NV Chemicalien Handle Rathkamp & Co. Based on the policy of nationalization of ex 
                Dutch companies at the beginning of the independence period; the Government of the Republic of Indonesia merged in 1958 a 
                number of pharmaceutical companies into PNF Bhinneka Kimia Farma. Then, on 16 August 1971, the form of PNF as legal entity 
                was changed to Limited Liability Company and the company’s name was changed to PT Kimia Farma (Persero). <br> <br>
                On 4 July 2001, PT Kimia Farma (Persero) changed again status to public company, PT Kimia Farma (Persero) Tbk, here in after 
                referred to as Company. Simultaneously with this change, the Company was listed at Jakarta Stock Exchange and Surabaya Stock 
                Exchange (currently both stock exchanges had been merged and now named Indonesia Stock Exchange). With tens of years of experience, 
                the Company has developed into a company with integrated health service in Indonesia. It has been increasingly engaged in the 
                development and building of the nation, particularly the building of health of the Indonesian community.
